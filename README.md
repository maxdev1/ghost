# ABOUT GHOST
**Ghost** is a hobbyist operating system for the x86-64 platform.
The OS is written from scratch in C/C++ and Assembly.

This is the main development repository.

**Project website:** http://ghostkernel.org/

## Documentation
See the `documentation` folder. It contains information about the technical design as well as detailed building instructions.

An usually up-to-date version of the documentation is provided here: https://ghostkernel.org/documentation/

## Live ISO

If you just want to play around with the latest state, you can download an ISO
image from the [release section](https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost/releases).

The suggested way to test it is in VirtualBox with at least 512MB of RAM and the
VMSVGA graphics adapter enabled for better performance.

## Quick-start

1. On your host machine (where Docker is installed), run `./docker-build-toolchain-image.sh`. This will 
    build an image that contains the cross-compiler and other tools required for building the operating system.
2. Once the process has finished, it will open a bash within the container. The container has this repository folder mounted to `/ghost/source`.
3. Build the operating system by running `./build.sh` in that directory within the container.

Afterwards, the `target` folder will contain the bootable ISO image.

To build with MinGW within WSL:

- First build all dependencies; use mingw-* scripts, in order:

		zlib
		pixman
		libpng
		freetype
		cairo

- They should all install to /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32

- Then, build the libraries, each with `sudo make clean && make target=windows && make target=windows install`

        libwindow
        libfont
        libproperties
        libjson

- Then, build windowserver with `sudo make clean && make target=windows && make target=windows install`

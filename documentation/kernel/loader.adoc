About
-----
The loader is a multiboot compliant binary which is loaded by GRUB on startup.
The binary is loaded to `0x00100000`. It itself reserves some memory (in its BSS)
which it uses as it's own stack.

The purpose of this loader is to provide a basic memory setup and load the kernel
binary to the expected start location.

1. *Memory setup*
+
A basic GDT is loaded which contains only kernel segment & data descriptors.
Information from the GRUB memory map is interpreted to find all free physical memory
and the physical memory allocator `g_bitmap_page_allocator` is initialized.
+

2. *Paging*
+
A page directory is allocated. The directory maps recursively.
The memory from `0x00000000` to the end of all memory used by the loader is identity-mapped.
The remaining multiboot-modules get relocated so they are mapped after the end
of the loader binary.
+

3. *Loading kernel*
+
The kernel itself is a simple ELF32 binary which has `0xC0000000` as its start address.
The loader searches for the module at `"/boot/kernel"` and loads it. The page tables in the
kernel area are pre-allocated and zeroed.
An initialization stack is allocated after the kernel image and after the stack
the kernel heap is allocated with an initial size of 16MiB.
+

4. *Enter kernel main*
+
The loader finally switches to the prepared kernel stack and enters the kernels main
entry function.
+


Memory layout
-------------
When entering the kernel, the initial page directory is layout as follows:

For visualization, the sizes of each area are greatly exaggerated; actually the empty memory
is much larger than depicted.

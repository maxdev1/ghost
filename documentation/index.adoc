This is the system documentation of the *Ghost* operating system.

This project is a hobby operating system for the Intel x86 platform with
almost all components written from scratch. The kernel follows a microkernel
design. This documentation contains both conceptual and technical details
for various parts of the system.

NOTE: This file is supposed to be compiled with AsciiDoctor

== Getting started
This document contains an explanation on how to build entire operating system from source.

Scripts in the repository are usually written for bash. On Windows, install link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[WSL] and continue from there. On Mac OS, it is recommended to use the Docker setup.

The operating system requires its own compiler and toolchain, which must be set up once. It is strongly recommended to use the <<Toolchain via Docker>> since it simplifies the setup a lot. If you want to install the toolchain on your host system, check the <<Toolchain on host>> section.

NOTE: The system root directory `sysroot` is reflects the filesystem of the target system. All libraries and applications are installed into this directory, which is then packed into the ramdisk during the build process. This ramdisk is what is mounted as the root of the running system.


== Toolchain via Docker

To run the toolchain in a Docker container you can either build the image yourself or pull the latest image from the GitHub repository.

=== Option A: Pull latest image

1. Pull the image:

	docker pull ghcr.io/maxdev1/ghost-toolchain-64:1.0

2. Start a container and mount the repository to it:

	docker run -it --name ghost-toolchain -v "$(pwd):/ghost/source" ghcr.io/maxdev1/ghost-toolchain-64:1.0

3. Go to the <<Build targets>> section below.

=== Option B: Build image

1. To get started, clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost

2. Within it, execute the following script. This will build the Docker image `ghost-toolchain` which includes everything required to build the operating system. Check the `/ghost-build.log` for outputs. This script will take a while.

	./docker-build-toolchain-image.sh


3. Once the image was built, a container will automatically be started. You can now skip to the <<Build targets>> section below.

=== Tips

To reconnect to the container after exiting it:

  docker exec -it ghost-toolchain bash


== Toolchain on host

=== Clone repositories
To get started, clone the repository to `/ghost/source`:

	git clone https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost /ghost/source

If you want to use a different folder, see the "Tips" section below.


=== Installing prerequisites

The following dependencies are requirements for the toolchain and need to be installed beforehand or else the script will fail:

* `apt-get update`
* `apt-get install libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libmpc-dev autoconf2.69 pkg-config xorriso grub-pc-bin make texinfo flex bison gcc g++ nasm asciidoc asciidoctor`

You may need to `export AUTOCONF=autoconf2.69` depending on your host system.


=== Build toolchain
Run the toolchain setup script `toolchain.sh`. It will attempt to do everything that is
necessary to create the toolchain. Once the toolchain was built, add it to your `PATH`.


== Build targets

The root `build.sh` contains a set of targets that will build everything required for the system (see `--help`).

After setting up the toolchain, simply run `./build.sh` and let it execute all targets. The first build will take some time, because the ported libraries (like cairo) need to be built.

Done? *Congratulations!* In the `target` folder you will now find the bootable ISO image `ghost.iso`.

NOTE: On some systems while running `build.sh`, the configure scripts of some ports
	might hang at either "checking for suffix of executables" or "checking whether
	we are crosscompiling". Run `killall conftest` to get it running again.

== Library dependency
To give a small overview on the dependencies, libapi is the lowest layer library that provides
wrapping of system calls. On top of this is the libc that utilizes libapi.

== Third-party software
To install third-party libraries, it is usually necessary to provide some parameters to the
`./configure` script:

* `--host=i686-ghost` to set the correct host
* `--prefix=/system` to install libraries to the correct folder

There is also a simplified port installation script in `patches/ports` that allows automatically
downloads, patches and installs some third-party libraries.


== Creating a bootable USB stick
You can create a bootable USB stick with the following steps.

1. Convert the `image.iso` file to an .img

	hdiutil convert -format UDRO -o converted.img image.iso

2. Find out which drive the USB stick is with

	diskutil list

3. Unmount the disk

	diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN

4. Write the image to the stick

	sudo dd if=converted.img of=/dev/rdiskN bs=1m

5. Unmount it again

	diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN


== Tips
* To specify a different toolchain base directory, modify `TOOLCHAIN_BASE`, copy the `variables.sh.template` to `variables.sh` and specify the variable with an export.
* While binutils and gcc are being built, the log output is redirected to a file named `ghost-build.log` in the respective build directory in the temporary folder. If the build fails for some reason, you should check this log file.

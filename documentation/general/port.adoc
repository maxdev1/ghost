Basics
------
`/patches/ports/port.sh` is a script that helps building libraries and software
for the system more easily.

To install one of the ports in the local port directory, use:

------------------------
sh port.sh libpng/1.6.18
------------------------

This will automatically download the source archive from the Ghost repository
(https://ghostkernel.org/repository/), apply the available patches and build
the library into the sysroot.


Port structure
--------------
The script only builds a small framework that allows it to be more flexible for
a variety of builds.

A port resides in a folder with the name of the library or application, then
a folder with its version. Each port _must_ have a `package.sh` file and may
optionally have a `patch.diff`.

[source,folder structure]
-----
libpng/
	1.6.18/
		package.sh
		patch.diff

Creating a port
---------------

The `package.sh` is the "description" for the port. It is first used to
determine where the source archive for the port shall be downloaded from,
what the archives file name is and where to unpack it. The second thing that
it defines must be the two functions `port_unpack` and `port_install`. The
following is an example taken from the libpng port:

[source,bash script]
-----
REMOTE_ARCHIVE="https://ghostkernel.org/repository/libpng/libpng-1.6.18.tar.gz"
UNPACKED_DIR=libpng-1.6.18
ARCHIVE=libpng-1.6.18.tar.gz

port_unpack() {
	tar -xf $ARCHIVE
}

port_install() {
	../$UNPACKED_DIR/configure --host=$TARGET --prefix=$PREFIX
	make
	make DESTDIR=$SYSROOT install
}
-----
	
When this port is installed, the script will perform a series of steps to
install the port.

. Create an empty output directory within the `build` folder
. Download the archive file into that directory
. Call `port_unpack` to unpack the archive
. Apply the `patch.diff` if supplied
. Call `port_install` to perform the installation

The variable `$SYSROOT` is given in the context of `port_install` and shall
be used to install the port to the system root.
